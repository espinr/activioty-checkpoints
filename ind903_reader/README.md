# IND903 UHF RFID Reader

This package contains a series of classes and scripts to control the IND903 UHF RFID Reader. Although this RFID reader module comes along with a SDK for Windows, this library aims at performing basic communication operations with the reader from a device running Python3.

Be careful and do not rely on this module if you want to do serious things, it was created for implementing a proof of concept. Read [more information about this implementation](https://github.com/espinr/activioty/blob/master/docs/checkpoints/rfid-reader-python/rfid-python.md).
